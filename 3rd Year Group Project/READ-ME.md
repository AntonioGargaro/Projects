# 3rd Year Group Project

Hi! This project is a link to my 3rd year group project and a little bit about what we had to do for it. We worked on this project in a group of seven people to design a food serving and ordering website which could take orders from customers in restaurants. We took inspiration from [Just Eat](Justeat.co.uk) and went for a card style approach. We also made the website work fully for mobile as well so you can easily use it on the go. 

There is also a fully functional waiter system and kitchen system. If you'd like to know more just contact me.
